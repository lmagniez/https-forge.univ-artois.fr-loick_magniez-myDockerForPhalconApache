The official project phalcon-compose allowing to create easily container with phalcon is no longer maintained. I tried in this project to create a basic docker container containing a lamp instance with phalcon installed.

The project use as a basis the mattrayner/lamp image available at this url:
https://hub.docker.com/r/mattrayner/lamp
